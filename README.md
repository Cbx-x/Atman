#⭐ ATMAN – Advanced Web Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Intelligence Framework

Atman is a powerful, modern, and highly configurable web reconnaissance framework designed for penetration testers, bug bounty hunters, and security teams.
It automates deep reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, data intelligence, and continuous monitoring — giving you a complete picture of an application’s attack surface.

Atman correlates reconnaissance data using a database-backed architecture and offers intelligent GPT-powered insights, attack surface suggestions, and vulnerability descriptions.

🚀 What is Atman?

Atman is a next-generation web reconnaissance suite built to simplify and accelerate information gathering.
It combines:

Automated subdomain discovery

Port and service enumeration

Fuzzing & endpoint extraction

Vulnerability scanning

OSINT enrichment

Continuous monitoring

AI-driven recon intelligence

…and organizes everything into structured workspaces for teams, freelancers, and bug bounty hunters.

If you want a complete start-to-end recon pipeline, Atman gives you everything in one unified platform.

🧠 Key Capabilities
🔍 Deep Reconnaissance

Subdomain enumeration

Alive host detection

IP & open port identification

Directory & file fuzzing

Endpoint extraction

Screenshot capture

WHOIS & WAF detection

S3 bucket misconfiguration checks

Automated vulnerability scanning using:

Nuclei

Dalfox

CRLFuzzer

Additional recon and misconfiguration tools

📡 OSINT Intelligence

Employee enumeration

Email harvesting

Meta information gathering

Google dorking for exposed files/URLs

Related domain discovery

🗂 Workspaces & Project Management

Organize recon data into separate, isolated workspaces such as:

Bug bounty programs

Client pentests

Internal audits

Long-term recon campaigns

Each workspace has its own dashboard and data store.

⚙️ Highly Configurable Scan Engines

YAML-based scan configurations

Customizable concurrency, rate limits, timeouts

Prebuilt engines (Full Scan, Passive Scan, OSINT Scan, Screenshot Scan)

Add your own recon pipelines

Support for parallel scans and subscans

Subscans allow you to run additional scans instantly on newly discovered assets — without waiting for the main pipeline to finish.

Generate fully customized PDF reports such as:

Full Recon Report

Vulnerability Report

OSINT Report

Customize:

Themes & colors

Executive summary

Footer & branding

Company information
